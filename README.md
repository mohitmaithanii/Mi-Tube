## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React.js allows for the creation of reusable UI components and ensures efficient rendering and updating of the DOM.

- **SCSS (Sass):** A CSS preprocessor that enhances the capabilities of standard CSS. SCSS offers variables, nesting, and mixins, making the styling of the application more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

- **Redux Toolkit:** A state management tool that simplifies the process of managing and updating the application state. Redux Toolkit provides a standardized and efficient approach to handling state changes, making the app more predictable and easier to debug.

- **TMDB API:** The Open Movie Database API is used to fetch detailed movie information, including titles, genres, ratings, and more. This external API allows Movie-X to provide rich and accurate data to users.
